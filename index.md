Start filling in the eligibility form with your **correct** personal information. It is extremely important that at least one of "Country of nationality" or "Country of residence" is set to Macedonia, as per your true status. Otherwise, the system will not consider you eligible for applying to UWC via the Macedonian National Committee, and you won't be able to access our application.

## Step 4: Personal Information

This section collects personal information. The information you enter in this section will be hidden from the evaluators of your application in order to ensure the process is fair and transparent.

Now you can move on to the next section: Language Selection.

## Step 5: Language Selection

Here, you get to choose which language you want to fill in your actual application &mdash; such as answers to the short questions and essays. Thus, it is crucial that you choose the language that you are **most comfortable** with. Your choice of language <u>will not advantage or disadvantage your application whatsoever,</u> and has no effect on any part of the grading.

Based on your language selection, the application form in your chosen language will appear, and you are able to start with filling it in.

**Note**: if, at any point, you change your mind about which language you want to fill your application in, you are able to choose a new language and start over. To do this, click on the three dots on the top-right of the box, and click Reset. If you had already written answers in the existing application, we recommend downloading them before resetting the language in order to prevent losing them.

Once you are happy with your language choice, you may again click on the application form in the corresponding language, and start filling it out as before.

## Step 6: Apply in your chosen language

Finally, you've made it to the part where you get to tell us about yourself!

Start by reading all the included instructions, and filling in your answers in your selected language. This section has multiple parts, which you can navigate via the Previous and Next buttons. As you are completing questions, we recommend you frequently click on Save & Continue editing in order to prevent losing your responses if your browser crashes or internet connection stops.

Note that in the Essay part of this section, one of the essays must be written in your native language (Macedonian/Albanian), and the other one in English. This is the only case in this section where you'll need to use a different language than your chosen one.

Once you have finished your answers and checked them, click on Mark as Complete at the end of the section. At this point, you will still be able to make changes to your answers as much as you need, as long as you haven't completed Step 8 (see below).
