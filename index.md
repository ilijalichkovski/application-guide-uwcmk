The steps below outline the procedure of using the SurveyMonkey Apply platform. The process consists of:
- registering an account and verifying your eligibility,
- filling out personal information,
- selecting a preferred language of application,
- filling out your answers to the actual application questions and essays.

After you finish writing your application and all sections are completed, you **must submit your application**, as outlined in **Step 8: Submit**. Even if you complete every section, but do not submit the application, the Macedonian National Committee will not be able to read your application. So please **ensure to click "Submit"** -- if you're in doubt whether we have received it, take a look at Step 9! 

Let's start!

## Step 1: Registration

Firstly, click the following link to access the UWC Macedonia application:

[Link to application](https://apply.uwc.org/prog/uwc_macedonia_application_national_committee_selection "Click here")

You may read the introductory paragraphs displayed on the page for details. Then, you need to register a SurveyMonkey account &mdash; you can do this by clicking the green **Register** button in the top right corner (shown in the image below):

## Step 2: Eligibility Form

After your email verification is complete, you will be redirected to the page shown below. <u> Do not worry about the "No applications" message</u> &mdash; the system simply needs some aditional information in order to present the appropriate application to you. Thus, click on the green **"View Programs"** box.

In the new page, click **"Fill out eligibility profile"**. This eligibility form is used by the system to verify which applications you can be considered for.

Start filling in the eligibility form with your **correct** personal information. It is extremely important that at least one of "Country of nationality" or "Country of residence" is set to Macedonia, as per your true status. Otherwise, the system will not consider you eligible for applying to UWC via the Macedonian National Committee, and you won't be able to access our application.

**Note**: If you hold a citizenship or residency in addition to your Macedonian one, you might be eligible for applying via other National Committees. Whichever one you choose, <u>you may only apply through that committee only.</u>

Next, ensure to select the **UWC National Committee** option as the application route &mdash; the Global Selection Programme is a different process and not relevant here.

Lastly, read the *UWC Data Protection Policy* and the *UWC Privacy Statement*, and upon doing so, tick the corresponding boxes. Complete the eligibility form by clicking **"Save my Profile"**.

## Step 3: Begin application!

Once you are directed to the next page, make sure to carefully read the description and instructions. These will be important as you begin the actual application process. Then, click on **Apply**.

This will lead you to the page shown below. In it, there are two tasks for you to complete: Personal Information and Language Selection. Select the Personal Information section.

## Step 4: Personal Information

This section collects personal information. The information you enter in this section will be hidden from the evaluators of your application in order to ensure the process is fair and transparent. 

Make sure that the information you enter in this section is true to the best of your knowledge. After the grading of the application is complete, the personal information will be matched with the rest of the application. 

Once you finish this section and consent to the processing of the information you provided, click on **"Mark As Complete"**.

With the personal information section done, now you can move on to the next section!

## Step 5: Language Selection

![](Screenshot_149.png)

Here, you get to choose which language you want to fill in your actual application &mdash; your answers to the short questions and essays. Thus, it is crucial that you choose the language that you are **most comfortable** with. Your choice of language <u>will not advantage or disadvantage your application whatsoever,</u> and has no effect on any part of the grading.

Based on your language selection, the application form in your chosen language will appear, and you are able to start with filling it in.

![](Screenshot_150.png)

**Note**: if, at any point, you change your mind about which language you want to fill your application in, you are able to choose a new language and start over. To do this, click on the three dots on the top-right of the box, and click Reset. If you had already written answers in the existing application, we recommend downloading them before resetting the language in order to prevent losing them.

Once you are happy with your language choice, you may again click on the application form in the corresponding language, and start filling it out as before.

## Step 6: Apply in your chosen language

Finally, you've made it to the part where you get to tell us about yourself!

Start by reading all the included instructions, and filling in your answers in your selected language. This section has multiple parts, which you can navigate via the Previous and Next buttons. As you are completing questions, we recommend you frequently click on Save & Continue editing in order to prevent losing your responses if your browser crashes or internet connection stops.

Note that in the Essay part of this section, one of the essays must be written in your native language (Macedonian/Albanian), and the other one in English. This is the only case in this section where you'll need to use a different language than your chosen one.

Once you have finished your answers and checked them, click on Mark as Complete at the end of the section. At this point, you will still be able to make changes to your answers as much as you need, as long as you haven't completed Step 8 (see below).

## Step 7: Review

Once all three sections (Personal Information, Language Selection and the Application Form) have been marked as complete, you will be able to review your application. Double-check your answers and your provided information. You are able go back to a specific section and make corrections if it is needed.

Finally, the review also gives you an opportunity to download all your answers &mdash; we advise you to do this for future reference.

## Step 8: Submit

Once you have completed the review, and you are satisfied with everything, click  the green **Submit** button on the left-hand side. Once you confirm your decision by clicking the Submit button again, the system  submits the application to us for review.

## Step 9: Check your email

Upon successful submission of your application, you should receive a confirmation email. Make sure to check the inbox of the email address you entered in the forms (including the Spam/Junk folder). The confirmation email looks like this:

![](Screenshot_155.png)

**Another way to check**: when you when you're logged into SurveyMonkey Apply, you can click on "view my applications" and check whether the status of your application says "submitted":

If you do not see a confirmation email anywhere, it might be possible that we have not received your application or a technical error has occurred. In this case, please contact us directly (info@mk.uwc.org).

## That's it! 

After you've ensured your application is submitted, keep an eye on your email inbox in December &mdash; we will contact you with the results!
